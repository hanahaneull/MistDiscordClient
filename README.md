# MistDiscordClient
Since we discontinued it a while ago before we started working on the rewrite called 'Lazarus', here you can look how it actually worked, also don't mind the yandere dev code. I didn't really care about beautifying the js back then.

# Note
I will not tell you how to set this up, also please don't skid off this. Most credits goto https://github.com/joe27g/EnhancedDiscord for code to study from in this client.
(Most of this code didn't use the webpack modules, so have fun laughing at that)
